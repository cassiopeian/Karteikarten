 *Hallo!* [Karteikarten](https://cassiopeian.github.io/Karteikarten/) (literally, "flashcards," or "index cards") is a supplementary learning tool, intended to strengthen beginners’ German-language vocabulary skills. 
 
 Organized into ten levels of increasing difficulty, Karteikarten features more than 300 German to English flashcards, color-coordinated by category.

 As you progress, the levels get longer and the words get trickier, but Flash will always congratulate you when you successfully complete a batch of flashcards. If you use any of the help tools during a round, you’ll see a Mini Review link on your checkpoint notification.

 Click the *categories* button, to reveal a hidden panel where you can curate a customized deck of flashcards, or challenge yourself with the lightning round. 

 The orange number displays the amount of flashcards in the lightning round, and the purple one represents the number of flashcards in any customized round you build. The purple figure will increase or decrease depending on how many categories you select.

 The icons of the categories you’ve selected will be purple-ringed, and the category name will turn bold.

## Favicon

 The Karteikarten favicon was designed to be a flag—in more ways than one. Sporting the hues of the German tricolor, the K-shaped (for *Karteikarten*) symbol is also meant to represent the kind of colorful, adhesive page flags one might use while studying. 

## Tech Specs

 Karteikarten was built with jQuery version 3.4.1.
