 Organized into ten levels of increasing difficulty, Karteikarten features more than 300 German to English flashcards, color-coordinated by category.

 The Karteikarten favicon was designed to be a flag—in more ways than one. Sporting the hues of the German tricolor, the K-shaped (for *Karteikarten*) symbol is also meant to represent the kind of colorful, adhesive page flags one might use while studying. 

## Tech Specs

 Karteikarten was built with jQuery version 3.4.1.
