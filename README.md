 *Hallo!* [Karteikarten](https://cassiopeian.github.io/Karteikarten/) (literally, "flashcards," or "index cards") is a supplementary learning tool, intended to strengthen beginners’ German-language vocabulary skills. 
 
 Organized into ten levels of increasing difficulty, Karteikarten features more than 300 German to English flashcards, color-coordinated by category.

 As you progress, the levels get longer and the words get trickier, but Flash will always congratulate you when you successfully complete a batch of flashcards. If you use any of the help tools during a round, you’ll see a Mini Review link on your checkpoint notification.

 ### Curated Decks

## Favicon

 The Karteikarten favicon was designed to be a flag—in more ways than one. Sporting the hues of the German tricolor, the K-shaped (for *Karteikarten*) symbol is also meant to represent the kind of colorful, adhesive page flags one might use while studying. 

## Tech Specs

 Karteikarten was built with jQuery version 3.4.1.
